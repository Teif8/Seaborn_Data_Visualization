# Seaborn_Data_Visualization
This repository provides a tutorial on how to create beautiful visualizations using the `Seaborn` library in Python. The examples demonstrate loading a dataset and generating different types of plots.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter notebook: seaborn_tutorial.ipynb and follow along with the examples.
Example Dataset

The tips dataset is used in this tutorial, which contains information about tips given in a restaurant, along with other relevant data like total bill, gender, time, etc.
Plotting Examples

	•	Importing Seaborn:
```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

	•	Loading the dataset:
```
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```

	•	Basic plotting:
```
sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=tips)
plt.show()
```
## seaborn_tutorial.ipynb:


The content of this file will be the Jupyter notebook where you import Seaborn, load the “tips” dataset, and generate various plots. Include sections for:

- Importing libraries
- Loading datasets
- Creating basic visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts, etc.)
- Advanced visualizations (pair plots, heatmaps, etc.)

## requirements.txt:

- seaborn
- matplotlib
- pandas
